# Database-and-Website-Project
Database and Website Interactive Project


This project was a website and database I created with a partner in a course at Oregon State University. The purpose of the project
was to create an interactive website that would display information from a database as well as submit information to the database. 
In addition, we coded that back end to receive and store information in tables. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for front end work
with Node.js and MySQL.
